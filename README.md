# üîê UnityWallet ‚Äî Cryptographic Token Wallet with NTRU & Pietrzak VDF

**UnityWallet** is a JavaScript-based cryptographic token system that includes:

- Asymmetric encryption and signatures using **NTRU** (Post-Quantum safe),
- A time-delay mechanism using **Pietrzak's Verifiable Delay Function (VDF)**,
- Transaction tracking and DAG-based ownership transfer,
- Full serialization/deserialization support for advanced types (`BigInt`, `Map`, `Date`, etc.).

---

## üöÄ Features

- üßÆ Deterministic token identity with timestamp
- ‚è≥ Proof-of-delay via VDF (Pietrzak)
- üîê NTRU-based asymmetric encryption & signing
- ‚úÖ Fast token and transaction verification
- üîÅ Token transfers with full traceability

---

## üì¶ Usage

### 1. Generate keys and a token
```js
const wallet = new UnityWallet(p, q);
const [privKey, pubKey] = await wallet.ntru.genKeys();
const token = await wallet.genToken(pubKey, 100n);
2. Verify the token
js
Kopiuj
Edytuj
const isValid = await wallet.verifyToken(token);
3. Create a transaction
js
Kopiuj
Edytuj
const tx = await wallet.genTransaction(tokenId, prevTxId, privKey, {
  from: pubKey,
  to: recipientPubKey,
  type: "spend",
  data: { value: 25n }
});
4. Verify the transaction
js
Kopiuj
Edytuj
const valid = await UnityWallet.verifyTransaction(tx, wallet.ntru);
‚è≥ VDF Performance
UnityWallet uses a recursive implementation of Pietrzak‚Äôs VDF, offering a strong separation between computation and verification time:

T (delay steps)	Proving Time (O(T))	Verifying Time (O(log¬≤ T))	Speedup
2‚Å∏ (256)	~256 ops	~88 ops	~3√ó
2¬π¬≤ (4096)	~4096 ops	~132 ops	~30√ó
2¬π‚Å∂ (65,536)	~65k ops	~176 ops	~370√ó
2¬≤‚Å∞ (1,048,576)	~1M ops	~220 ops	~5,000√ó
2¬≤‚Å¥ (16M)	~16M ops	~264 ops	~70,000√ó

This makes it ideal for delay-based randomness, anti-front-running, or decentralized time locks.

üîê NTRU-based Encryption
js
Kopiuj
Edytuj
const encrypted = await wallet.ntru.encrypt(data, password);
const decrypted = await wallet.ntru.decrypt(encrypted, password);
Supports:

Fast key generation

Asymmetric encryption & decryption

Deterministic VRF

Post-quantum safety (NTRU lattice-based)

üìÇ Serialization
Custom serialize / deserialize functions allow the encoding of:

BigInt, Set, Map, Symbol, Date, RegExp, File, etc.

Fully deterministic object ordering (for hashing & signing)

üîß Installation
No bundler required. You can use it in the browser or import as an ES module.

üìà Future Plans
Full DAG ownership model

Token metadata and lock-in rules

Transaction weighting / fee system

Aggregate signatures
