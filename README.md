UnityWallet: Practical VDF-Based Token Generator

UnityWallet is a JavaScript/TypeScript library that implements a simple, deterministic, and verifiable token generation system based on a practical Verifiable Delay Function (VDF).

This approach provides:

üß† Predictable computational cost

üîç Easy and fast verification

üîí Resistance to precomputation and forgery

‚õìÔ∏è Ideal for use in token-based systems, NFT validation, or proof-of-effort

üîß How It Works

Each token is generated by computing a public seed:

x = sha256(pubKey + value + timestamp)

Then a deterministic sum is calculated:

proof = sum( hash(x + i) * modInv(hash(x + i), p) ) for i = 0 .. (value - 1)

Where:

p is a fixed large prime (2^256 - 189 by default)

modInv(a, p) is the modular inverse of a mod p

The token is accepted if:

proof % p === value

‚úÖ Verification is fast:

Recompute x from the public data.

Pick a random i ‚àà [0, value).

Compute partial = hash(x + i) * modInv(hash(x + i), p).

Verify:

(proof - partial) % p === value - 1n

üß† Why This Is Powerful

Unlike traditional proof-of-work:

No need for random nonces or retries.

No brute-force ‚Äî cost grows linearly with value.

Token value is the proof of computation.

Unlike academic VDFs:

No RSA trapdoor or trusted setup.

Entirely verifiable on-chain or in-browser.

Simple, readable, and self-contained.

üì¶ Example Use

const wallet = new UnityWallet(p, q);
const token = await wallet.genToken(pubKey, 128n); // Takes ~128 steps
const valid = await wallet.verifyToken(token); // Fast check

You can use this as a fair delay mechanism, anti-spam proof, token minting rule, etc.
